# hitch_matching_bot
This is the code for the telegram bot that matches drivers and passengers for transport to the nearest train station. The first deployment is meant to bridge Micron F10A employees without cars and Woodlands North MRT station with the help of kind team members who drive, as the walk to the nearest bus stop is 1km.
